<td >Light was baptised in Dallinghoo, Suffolk, England on 15 December 1740. His mother was given as Mary Light. Taken in by a relative, the nobleman William Negus, he attended Woodbridge Grammar School[2] from 1747.[3] Researchers initially believed Light to be the illegitimate son of William Negus, but according to author Noël Francis Light Purdon,[4] the six-times great-grandson of Francis Light, Negus received payment for looking after him and acting as his guardian throughout his education.</td>
